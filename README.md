# CTD on Death

Very simple NetScriptFramework Plugin that will crash the game using `Main.Instance.QuitGame = true` when the player dies.

This doesn't really has any purpose except being a good starting point for NetScriptFramework Plugin development.

## Save file deletion

Added options in 2.0 to delete saves on death. You can change what settings are affected (Auto saves, Quick saves and Regular saves).

## Skyrim Removal

Added an option in 3.0 to uninstall Skyrim via Steam on death.
